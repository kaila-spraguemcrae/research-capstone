## Name of Project: TBD

#### Project's Purpose or Goal: 

LINGER is a visual journey. It is a place on the web where you can sit realax and look around. I plan to achieve this by creating a fantastical landscape or an abstract space. A user will be able to interact with the space by click on objects and moving through the space. 

#### Minimum Viable Product:

- create a 3D environment using React/JavaScript
- allow user to look around the environment with mouse
- have a clear color story

#### Tools and Technologies:

- React
- react-three-fiber
- three.js
- possibly Redux

#### Stretch Goals:

- add functionality for user to move throughout the space
    - user can move right/left and forward/backward
- add interactive objects in the space
    - on click objects change
    - elements are reactive to user mouse
- add oppening page/ splash page
    - title page with a button that brings you to the full 3D space
- add atmospheric sound
- have multiple 3D spaces
- the multiple 3d spaces are found by exploring

#### Additional Technologies:

- tone.js
